# Dropdown Boxes

- [ ] Avoid dropdowns for major site navigation or tables of contents

- [ ] Avoid interacting dropdowns whose options change, unless it's an autocomplete or search box. This is confusing to users.

- [ ] Gray out unavailable options.

- [ ] Avoid long lists (that might require scrolling) in dropdowns. Consider [mega-menus][1] or text completion instead.

- [ ] Avoid dropdowns for content that is highly familiar to users (e.g. years)

- [ ] Keep the menu label or description in view when the dropdown is open.
