# Links

- [ ] Use `aria-label` on `<a>` elements to have that text read instead of the text inside the link. Useful when your visual text isn't descriptive enough.

- [ ] The purpose of a link should be clear from a) the link text, b) the text of the containing element, or c) the heading above the link. Make links descriptive and not context-dependent.

- [ ] Don't make [links like this](https://danielhieber.com) which don't tell you where they're going and what the content is. Write out the content of the link explicitly, or use parentheses after the word(s) you would have placed the link on, e.g. "some sites (like [danielhieber.com](https://danielhieber.com))".

- [ ] Don't use block-level links. They should be inline.

- [ ] Do not open links in a new tab (`target=_blank`). Users can do this on their own, and it deprives them of the ability to *not* open items in a new tab.

- [ ] [Use accessible download links][1] (rather than download buttons)
