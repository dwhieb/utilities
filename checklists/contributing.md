# CONTRIBUTING Checklist

A checklist for writing contributor guidelines.

- Reporting issues
- Possibly an independent `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (but retain mention of issues in the README)
- Project management (e.g. GitHub project board)
- Good first issue: Issues for newbies / newcomers to the project
- Help wanted: Which issues / kinds of issues would be particularly helpful, or good for an outside developer to tackle?
- Roles
  - Contributor (any contribution)
  - Developer (write access)
  - Maintainer (can be multiple)
- Adding oneself to the contributors list (includes all 3 roles)
- Setting up the development environment
- Project structure, file-naming conventions, and file descriptions
- Code documentation
  - Commenting
  - Self-documenting code (**TODO:** checklist)
- Versioning
- Credentials
