# CONTRIBUTING Checklist

A checklist for writing contributor guidelines.

- [ ] Reporting issues
- [ ] Possibly an independent `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (but retain mention of issues in the README)
- [ ] Project management (e.g. GitHub project board)
- [ ] Good first issue: Issues for newbies / newcomers to the project
- [ ] Help wanted: Which issues / kinds of issues would be particularly helpful, or good for an outside developer to tackle?
- [ ] Roles
  - Contributor (any contribution)
  - Developer (write access)
  - Maintainer (can be multiple)
- [ ] Adding oneself to the contributors list (includes all 3 roles)
- [ ] Setting up the development environment
- [ ] Project structure, file-naming conventions, and file descriptions
- [ ] Code documentation
  - [ ] Commenting
  - [ ] Self-documenting code (**TODO:** checklist)
- [ ] Versioning
- [ ] Credentials
