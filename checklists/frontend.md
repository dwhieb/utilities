### Lazy-Loading Assets

- [ ] Lazy-load assets with `dns-prefetch`, `preconnect`, `prefetch`, or `preload`. Use `preload` when you're confident the resource will be used on the page, and `prefetch` when it *may* be used on the page. `prefetch` works during idle times, while `preload` grabs the resource as soon as possible. [More info][13].

- [ ] Preload (`rel=preload`) resources that you are confident will be used on the page (this tells the browser to load the asset as soon as possible)

- [ ] Prefetch resources that *may* be used later (this tells the browser to load them during idle times)

  ```html
  <link rel="prefetch" href="/images/big.jpeg">
  ```

- [ ] Prerender pages that are known to be loaded in the near future

  ```html
  <link rel="prerender" href="http://css-tricks.com">
  ```

- [ ] Do not lazy-load *all* assets, or the value of lazy-loading will be negated. Use `dns-prefetch` or `preconnect` for some resources that do not need to be loaded early, but will be used later in the page.

- [ ] Lazy-load non-critical CSS, with appropriate `<noscript>` fallbacks as needed

  ```html
  <link rel=preload href=path/to/mystylesheet.css as=style onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">

  <noscript>
    <link rel=stylesheet href=path/to/mystylesheet.css>
  </noscript>
  ```

- [ ] Lazy-load non-critical JS (including third-party scripts) with the `async` or `defer` attributes, or with a resource hint like `rel=prefetch` or `rel=dns-prefetch`

![lazy-loading JS][7]

- [ ] Lazy-load HTML as appropriate

  ```html
  <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="http://example.com">
  <!-- Only if the remote server uses HTTPS -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.example.com">
  ```

- [ ] Use web workers to cache assets for quick loading

- [ ] Use the [Intersection Observer API][5] to only load assets when the relevant part of the page comes into view

- [ ] Minify JavaScript files

- [ ] Minify HTML files

- [ ] Inline critical CSS, minified, in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`

- [ ] Inline SVG icons and images

- [ ] Load CSS files before JS files

- [ ] Place `href` attribute first in an element

- [ ] Specify global prefetch policy - you can also specify this on a case-by-case basis using `rel=dns-prefetch`

  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="x-dns-prefetch-control" content="off|on">
  ```

- [ ] Prefer Handlebars comments over HTML comments (where appropriate)

## Security

- [Observatory][12]
- [Security Headers][11]

- [ ] Deliver all content over HTTPS (make sure the `Strict-Transport-Security` header is set).
- [ ] Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff`
- [ ] Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN`
- [ ] Set the `Content-Security-Policy` header
