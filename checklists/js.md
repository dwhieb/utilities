# JavaScript Checklist

## General Guidelines

> Be conservative in what you do, liberal in what you accept.

- Allow your API to handle flexible inputs, but always provide consistent outputs.

- Fail fast: Allow flexible inputs, but still validate them when they are unpredictable, or user input.

## Latest Syntax & Features

- [ ] Use `element.closest()` to traverse the DOM upwards

## Development

* `console.trace()`: Shows where the log is being prompted from.
* `console.time()` & `console.timeEnd()`: Time how long it takes for a process to complete.
* `console.count()`: Keep count of how many times a step occurs.
* `console.clear()`: Clears the console.
* `console.table()`: Print a table of the attributes on a set of Objects.

## Regular Expressions

- [ ] Use the unicode (`u`) and dotAll (`s`) flags by default

- [ ] Used named capture groups in Regular Expressions whenever possible
