A checklist for planning, developing, and publishing a release, from start to finish.

## Notes
* Not currently using milestones
* Keep a continuous `dev` branch
* Only use Squash & Merge commits for `master` branch
* Do not allow commits to the `master` branch without an override

## Pre-Coding
* Open an issue
* Label issue
* Triage issue on the project board
* Project Board: To Do
* Project Board: In Progress
* Create issue branch (from `dev`)

## Coding
* Update external documentation with planned changes (README)
* Debug with Chrome Dev Tools (use `--inspect` flag with Node)
* Update dependencies
  - [ ] npm
  - [ ] Node
  - [ ] npm packages
