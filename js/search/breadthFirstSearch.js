/**
 * A breadth-first graph searching algorithm. The graph must be an Object/Array whose values are Arrays. (A nested array graph is most typical.)
 * @param  {Object|Array} graph   The graph to search. Each value in the graph must be an Array.
 * @param  {Function}     match   A matching function that accepts a node as its argument and returns true when the correct node is found
 * @param  {String}       [start] The node to begin searching from
 * @return {Object}               Returns an Object with 3 properties: `match` (the matched item), `distance` (the number of nodes from the start to the end point), and `path` (an Array of the nodes on the shortest path)
